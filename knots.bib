The evolution trails of protein knots, however, remain elusive. We used circular permutation to change an evolutionally conserved topologically knotted SPOUT RNA methyltransferase into an unknotted form. The unknotted variant adopted the same three-dimensional structure and oligomeric state as its knotted parent, but its folding stability was markedly reduced with accelerated folding kinetics and its ligand binding was abrogated. Our findings support the hypothesis that the universally conserved knotted topology of the SPOUT superfamily evolved from unknotted forms through circular permutation under selection pressure for folding robustness and, more importantly, for functional requirements associated with the knotted structural element."

Proteins are sufficiently well designed that their folding is not dominated by local energetic traps. Therefore, protein models that encode only the folded structure and are energetically unfrustrated (Gō-type), can capture the essentials of the folding routes. We investigate the folding thermodynamics of IL-1β using such a model and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We develop an enhanced sampling technique (a modified multicanonical method) to overcome the sampling problem caused by the slow folding. We find that IL-1β has a broad and high free energy barrier. In addition, the protein fold causes intermediate unfolding and refolding of some native contacts within the protein along the folding trajectory. This “backtracking” occurs around the barrier region. Complex folds like the β-trefoil fold and functional loops like the β-bulge of IL-1β can make some of the configuration space unavailable to the protein and cause topological frustration."

These are formed during the folding process and are tightened in a specific (i.e. native) location, along the poly-peptide chain. The existence of knots hence implies a high degree coordination of local and global conformational changes, during the folding reaction. In this work we investigate how the knot is formed and what are the dynamical mechanisms which drive the self-entanglement process. To this end, we report on the first atomistically detailed numerical simulation of the folding of a knotted protein, based on a realistic description of the inter-atomic forces. These simulations show that the knot is formed by following a specific sequence of contacts. The comparison of the findings with those based on simplified folding models suggest that the productive succession of contacts is aided by a concerted interplay of amino acid interactions, arguably including non-native ones.},

    abstract = {Author Summary Self-tying of knotted proteins remains a challenge both for theoreticians and experimentalist. In this work, we study the proteins with complex, the 52 knot, in a bulk and confined within a chaperonin box. We show that in our model we recreate the experimental results, identify two topologically distinct folding pathways and explain the beneficial role of confinement for complex knotted proteins. Encapsulation provides a possibility to fold via alternative pathway—folding via trefoil intermediate knot (N-terminal pathway) from entropic reason while folding via the C-terminal (direct tying) appears with the same probability. The results of this work show, how crowded environment in the real cell may enhance self-tying of proteins. The results are also the first step to the identification of possible oligomerization-prone forms of UCHs, which may cause neurodegenerative diseases.},

This peculiar mechanism, which only requires a few kBT, is not only interesting from an aesthetic point of view but may also play a role in future technological applications such as nanopore sequencing once strand sizes exceed 100,000 base pairs.We propose a mechanism in which two molecular knots pass through each other and swap positions along a polymer strand. Associated free energy barriers in our simulations only amount to a few kBT, which may enable the interchange of knots on a single DNA strand.},

abstract="Most proteins need to avoid the complex topologies when folding into the native structures, but some proteins with nontrivial topologies have been found in nature. Here we used protein unfolding simulations under high temperature and all-atom G{\={o}}-model to investigate the folding mechanisms for two trefoil knot proteins. Results show that, the contacts in $\beta$-sheet are important to the formation of knot protein, and if these contacts disappeared, the knot protein would be easy to untie. In the G{\={o}}-model simulations, the folding processes of the two knot proteins are similar. The compact structures of the two knot proteins with the native contacts in $\beta$-sheet are formed in transition state, and the intermediate state has loose C-terminal. This model also reveals the detailed folding mechanisms for the two proteins.",
